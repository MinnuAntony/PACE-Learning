 1. networking fundamentals:

part 1 : host,ip address, network
part 2 : Repeater, hub, bridge, switch, router

host: any device which sends or recieves traffic - eg : computer,lap,phones,printers,servers,cloud servers, iot devices
host can be clients and servers

ip address: identity of each host to send and recieve packets in the internet
its 32 bits - divided into 4 octets
ACME - 10.X.X.X (owns)
subnet - ?

Network - connection bw hosts
logical grouping of hosts which require similar connectivity -  forms a subnet or LAN segment, where all hosts share the same IP subnet, but each host has a unique IP address.
networks can contain other networks called subnets
network connect to other network -  internet

devices: 

Repeater: device used for regeneration
A repeater is a device that receives a weak or distorted signal,
cleans it up (amplifies and reshapes it), and retransmits it at its original strength and quality
it operates in layer1 - physical layer

Hub - Bridge - Switch : all acts a centre point where all hosts will be connected

Hub : is a mulitport repeater 
everyhost recieves data from every other hosts which brings us to bridges

Bridge  - has only two ports (layer2)
A bridge connects two or more LANs to act as a single network, while filtering traffic intelligently
- two sets of hosts connected using hub 
- h1 h2 h3 connected to hub1  --------- BRIDGE----------- h4 h5 h6 -> hub2

Switch: hub+switch kindof - facilitates communication within network - layer2 - MAC address
Routers: facilitate communication between networks - layer3 - ip addresses

Access Point-The wireless connector -  layer 2
Job: Connects wireless devices (phones, laptops) to the wired network (LAN).
Use case:
Wi-Fi in your home — your phone connects to the AP, which connects to the switch/router
-------------
Application → Presentation → Session:
WhatsApp prepares your message (text, emoji, image) → encrypts → opens secure session with WhatsApp server.

Transport Layer: (service to service) 
Data broken into TCP segments (reliable delivery ensured).
->ensures that the right programs recieves the right packets (service to service)
-> Addressing scheme : ports (0-65535) TCP/UDP 


Network Layer: (end to end)
Each segment gets an IP address to reach the destination server.
L3 tech: Anything with IP

Data Link Layer: (hop to hop)
Packets are turned into Ethernet/Wi-Fi frames that can move through your local network via switches and routers.
-> interacts with the wire in L1
   eg : NIC or WiFi access cards
-> Addressing scheme :MAC address

Physical Layer:
Frames become electrical signals or Wi-Fi radio waves — physically transmitted to your router and out to the Internet.
->transfer of bits; L1 Technologies:  cables,wifi,repeater,hub

Reverse Process (on receiver’s side):
The layers unpack the data in reverse order — physical → data link → network → transport → session → presentation → application.
Finally, WhatsApp decrypts the data and shows the message on your friend’s screen

* why are ip and mac addresses required?
* All networking devices connect hosts, but each one works at a different OSI layer, and thus plays a different role in how the data moves — physically, logically, and intelligently.

OSI MODEL:

Hosts must follow a set of rules in a nw.
Rules of Networking are divided inot 7 different layers
Each layer servers a specific function

Why We Need Both IP and MAC Addresses in Networking
In computer networking, two types of addresses play crucial roles: IP addresses and MAC addresses. While they may seem similar, they serve distinct purposes at different layers of the OSI model — and both are essential for successful data transmission.

 Layer 2: MAC Addresses (Data Link Layer)
MAC (Media Access Control) address is a physical address hardcoded into a device’s network interface card (NIC).
It is used for local communication within the same network (LAN).
MAC addresses are essential for frame delivery — the actual transmission of data over Ethernet or Wi-Fi.

Layer 3: IP Addresses (Network Layer)

IP (Internet Protocol) address is a logical address assigned to a device, often dynamically via DHCP.
It is used for routing data across different networks, including the internet.
IP addresses help identify the source and destination of data at a global scale.

 Why Both Are Needed
You might wonder: Why not just use IP addresses since they’re unique and routable?
Here’s why that doesn’t work:
IP Alone Can’t Deliver Frames
IP operates at Layer 3, which is responsible for routing — not physical delivery.
Network interfaces (NICs) don’t understand IP addresses directly; they need MAC addresses to send and receive frames.
To send a packet, the system uses ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) to map the destination IP to a MAC address, then encapsulates the IP packet into a frame for delivery.

 MAC Alone Can’t Route Across Networks
MAC addresses are not routable and only work within the same local network.
They lack the hierarchical structure needed for scalable routing across the internet.

NETWORK PROTOCOLS :
1. HTTP uses a request-response model. client make requests to servers for resources like
pages,images or API data
Server sends back responses like 200 OK(status codes)
HTTP defines methods like GET,POST,PUT and DELETE that trigger diff opns on the server (CRUD)

2. HTTPS - HTTP +TLS
encrypted connection achieved by tls

3. HTTP/3 - uses UDP
4. QUIC
5. WebSocket - realtime convo,realtime updates -TCP?
