yt vdo: Devops Journey
-----------------------
jenkins is an automation platform that allows you to buil,test and deploy s/w using pipelines

Jenkins Infra
1. Master server -> controls the pipelines and schedules build to agents
2. Agents ->  performs the build in their workspace
flow: a dev commits the code to github, the jenkins master becomes aware of this commit, and triggers the appropriate pipeline and distributes the build to one of the agents to run.

The agents are selected based on configured labels (via jenkins UI)

Agent types: 
1. Permanent Agents
2. Cloud Agents - docker,k8s, etc also ec2 fleet

2 main build jobs: 
1. freestyle build projects (easy and shell scripting)
2. pipelines(uses jenkins files written using groovy syntax
  they are broken into different stages like 
CLone, : cloning repo
Build, : genrates jar or some executable file
Test, 
Package, : packaged up
Deploy   : artifacts sent to registry
