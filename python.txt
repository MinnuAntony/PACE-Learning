what is virtual environment?
a self contained location that enables you to maintain separate and isolated env for your python projects.
adv:
managae dependencies,packages,etc 
why is it needed? each project may require different versions of external libraries or even python itself.
so venv allows each project to have its own set of installed packages independent of what is installed globally

in windows:
creating venv:  python -m venv <name of env>  (use python3 for mac or linux)
activating : <nameofenv>\Scripts\activate (source <nameofenv>/bin/activate)
deactivate : deactivate

installing packages into venv: 
pip list (shows packages inside venv)
to save these dependencies : pip freeze > requirements.txt

pip install -r requirements.txt ( -r means from a file)
